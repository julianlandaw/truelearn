<hr id=answer>

<u><b>Inspiratory stridor</b></u><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">A child who presents with inspiratory stridor should be considered to have an extrathoracic upper airway obstruction until proven otherwise.&nbsp; Causes of this obstruction include a foreign body in the upper airway, epiglottitis, or croup.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Foreign body aspiration is one of the leading causes of death among children today.&nbsp; Upon initial presentation, after ensuring that the patient can adequately ventilate and oxygenate, the most important diagnostic information that must be rapidly obtained is the location of the foreign body.&nbsp; Specifically, the determination of whether the foreign body is in the upper or lower airway is critical.&nbsp; Patients with an extrathoracic upper airway obstruction will tend to demonstrate obstruction on inspiration when the venturi effect of air moving through the upper airway will tend to cause collapse.&nbsp; This collapse can be mitigated by CPAP, however, the native respiratory drive should be maintained when caring for a patient with an upper airway obstruction whenever possible.&nbsp; An overly forceful ventilatory effort with positive pressure may drive the foreign body into the lower airway and further compromise ventilation.&nbsp; This dynamic airway collapse is why patients with croup, epiglottitis, and an upper airway foreign body will tend to have inspiratory stridor.&nbsp; Radiographic imaging may be helpful if the foreign body is radio-opaque, but this is often negative.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Patients with lower airway foreign bodies will typically present with expiratory stridor, as well as a markedly prolonged expiratory phase.&nbsp; It may be helpful to consider this pathology as being similar to asthma or other obstructive diseases of the small airway.&nbsp; During inhalation under negative pressure ventilation, the lungs airways are pulled open by the negative intrapleural pressure, allowing air to pass beyond the foreign body obstruction.&nbsp; During exhalation, however, the lungs experience positive pressure and the airways collapse onto the obstruction, impairing the exhalation past the obstruction.&nbsp; By prolonging the expiratory phase, the positive pressure on the lungs is mitigated and air may be able to move past the obstruction.&nbsp; Patients with an endobronchial obstruction will tend to present with choking and intractable coughing.&nbsp; If the foreign body remains in the trachea, the classic triad of asthmatoid wheeze, audible slap from the foreign body against the trachea during ventilation, and a palpable thud over the trachea are characteristic.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Regardless of the location of the foreign body, the anesthetic goals are reasonably similar.&nbsp; The agitation of the child should be minimized by any means possible.&nbsp; With an upper airway obstruction especially, the forced inhalation that occurs after a cry will result in the dynamic collapse of the airway and can significantly compromise ventilation.&nbsp; Procedures that upset the child such as venipuncture or arterial puncture must be minimized.&nbsp; Parent-present induction should be considered to avoid the distress that is likely to occur on parental separation.&nbsp; Provisions for an emergent surgical airway must be prepared should the above-mentioned airway obstruction occur and intubation/mask ventilation becomes impossible.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">A gentle inhaled parent-present inhaled induction may be performed with emphasis on maintaining the native respiratory drive.&nbsp; Preoperative placement of a topical local anesthetic may facilitate IV catheter placement under a light plane of anesthesia.&nbsp; Once the IV catheter is placed, the anesthetic can be deepened safely and CPAP can be administered in the event of upper airway obstruction.&nbsp; At this point, the airway can be turned over to the surgeons who may perform direct laryngoscopy or rigid bronchoscopy depending on the location of the airway obstruction.&nbsp; Avoidance of neuromuscular blockade is crucial, particularly in upper airway obstruction as positive pressure can create a ball-valve effect and completely occlude the upper airway.<br></span><br><strong>Bottom Line:&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Both drooling and inspiratory stridor are common presenting symptoms in an upper airway obstruction whether from a foreign body or infectious cause.&nbsp; The anesthetic plan for the removal of an upper airway obstruction should focus on minimizing the agitation of the patient as well as maintaining the native respiratory drive throughout the case.&nbsp; Positive pressure ventilation may be used cautiously if needed to stent open the upper airway.&nbsp; However, there is a concern for dislodging the foreign body and passing it into the lower airway with overly forceful ventilatory efforts.&nbsp; For upper airway obstructions, muscle relaxants are avoided as positive pressure can result in complete occlusion of the glottis and/or trachea.</span></left></td></tr><tr><td width="33.333333333333336%"><left><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);

The abnormality may be associated with a cleft palate, which occurs due to a persistent defect between the embryonic palatal shelves. An isolated unilateral cleft lip is the most prevalent defect and is usually an isolated finding, although up to 30% of cleft lip cases may be syndromic. In addition to apparent cosmetic concerns, feeding difficulty and speech impediments may occur in children with uncorrected defects, so surgical correction of an isolated cleft lip is often performed before six months of age.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">To provide postoperative analgesia to patients undergoing cleft lip repair, clinicians may elect to administer systemic analgesics, infiltrate local anesthetic to produce a field block at the operative site, or perform a targeted block of the infraorbital nerve.

The infraorbital nerve is a terminal branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V2) and emerges from the infraorbital foramen inferior to the orbital rim along with the infraorbital artery and vein.

<u><b>Bladder</b></u>&nbsp;<br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Bladder temperature will vary the greatest from cerebral temperature during active rewarming. Temperature-sensing Foley catheters are commonly and reliably used to monitor core temperature while patients are under general anesthesia. However, during dynamic temperature changes such as the rewarming phase of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), bladder temperature is an unreliable indicator of core or cerebral temperature. In fact, it can underestimate cerebral temperature by up to 2°C to 4°C. This discrepancy is attributed to decreased kidney perfusion and urine output during CPB along with the increased distance from the aortic cannula where the warmed blood is entering the body.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">During hypothermic CPB, the body is deliberately cooled to induce cerebral protection with hopes of minimizing adverse neurologic outcomes. Hypothermia confers cerebral protection by decreasing cerebral metabolic rate (CMRO</span><sub>2</sub><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">) and creating a favorable balance of oxygen supply and demand.

During the rewarming period, the brain is at risk of hyperthermia, defined as a temperature &gt;37°C. Hyperthermia increases cerebral metabolic rate and perfusion, making the brain susceptible to ischemic reperfusion injury as well as microemboli. Because brain parenchyma temperature cannot be measured directly during cardiac surgery, it is important to understand which temperature monitoring sites are accurate surrogates of cerebral temperature.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><u><b>Jugular bulb venous temperature</b></u> is considered to be the “gold standard” indicator of cerebral temperature. Because 99% of jugular bulb blood flow comes from cerebral circulation, it reliably predicts brain surface temperature during rewarming. The validity of jugular bulb temperature monitoring has been confirmed by several neurosurgical studies in patients undergoing profound hypothermia. Despite its accuracy, it is rarely used in cardiac surgery because of the invasive nature of the monitoring technique. Positioning the monitor in the jugular bulb requires that a temperature-capable venous catheter be placed in the internal jugular vein and then advanced cranially to the correct location.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><u><b>Nasopharyngeal temperature</b></u> monitoring is an easy, noninvasive technique used in most cardiac surgeries. Because of its proximity to the aortic cannula and great vessels, the nasopharynx remains relatively well perfused during CPB. Nevertheless, it has still been found to underestimate cerebral temperature by 0.5 to 2°C during rewarming. Although this discrepancy is less significant than that of the bladder, it should be understood so that cerebral hyperthermia can be avoided. The accuracy of nasopharyngeal temperature measurements is further limited by the variation in the positioning of the temperature probe. Results of recent studies have provided evidence that nasopharyngeal temperature is a more reliable predictor of core temperature when the thermometer is positioned 10 to 20 cm beyond the nares.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><u><b>Oxygenator arterial outlet temperature</b></u> measures the temperature of the arterial blood leaving the CPB circuit and entering the body via aortic cannula. Because of the proximity of the aortic cannula to the brain and ease of measurement, the arterial outlet temperature is frequently used as a surrogate for cerebral temperature. Nevertheless, researchers have found small discrepancies on the order of ±0.5°C between arterial oxygenator and jugular bulb temperatures. Because of a small but potential cerebral temperature underestimation, it is recommended that the temperature of the oxygenator arterial outlet does not exceed 37°C.</span><br><br><strong>Bottom Line:&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Hypothermia is often used for cerebral protection during cardiopulmonary bypass.

It is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) into inactive metabolites, but another metabolic pathway exists that produces an active metabolite. Metabolism by CYP2D6, a minor pathway metabolizing 11% of oxycodone, results in the production of oxymorphone. Oxymorphone is eightfold more potent than oxycodone. In theory, CYP2D6 ultrametabolizers can metabolize a larger proportion of oxycodone, generating more oxymorphone and potentially causing an overdose. In addition, if a patient is taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor, more oxycodone will be metabolized by CYP2D6, resulting in more of the potent oxymorphone metabolite.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Codeine is also metabolized by CYP2D6, but it is a prodrug that must be metabolized to morphine to have a clinical effect. Patients who are slow CYP2D6 metabolizers have poor analgesia, whereas patients (especially children) who are ultrametabolizers can experience toxicity and overdose.

Nitrous oxide is cheap and reliable and provides some degree of analgesia. Nitrous is known to expand air-containing spaces. Nitrous oxide diffuses from the blood into air-containing spaces much faster than nitrogen can diffuse back out, resulting in the expansion of the space. Some clinicians will avoid nitrous oxide as part of their anesthetic for fear of intestinal/colonic distention, which may obstruct surgical visualization, decrease intestinal contractility, and increase the risk of leakage and anastomotic breakdown. This practice was based on results of studies conducted in dogs in the 1960s in which the intestinal gas was measured before and after nitrous oxide was administered for several hours. There was an increase in the gas volume of 100% to 300%.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Results of subsequent studies have confirmed that nitrous oxide does not alter surgical conditions during short-duration laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There is evidence that the use of nitrous oxide during intestinal and colonic surgery may make surgery more difficult due to bowel expansion from nitrous oxide diffusion. According to the results of a donor nephrectomy study, one in four procedures required the cessation of nitrous oxide because it interfered with the progress of surgery. For short-duration bariatric surgery and laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery, results of two studies provided no evidence of significant effect on visualization. This provides evidence that the duration of surgery is a major factor for nitrous oxide affecting surgical visualization.<br></span><br><strong>Bottom Line:&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Nitrous oxide can affect surgical visualization during prolonged procedures.

Electrolyte abnormalities such as hyperkalemia are a marker of toxicity and a predictor of mortality. Despite its atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking properties,&nbsp;when digoxin levels rise above therapeutic levels (0.8-2 ng/mL), digoxin becomes proarrhythmic. Digoxin toxicity results in an excessive amount of intracellular calcium, which can result in delayed after-depolarizations. This can then lead to premature contractions triggering arrhythmias. Additionally, digoxin shortens repolarization and decreases the refractory period of the myocardium, which, in turn, increases automaticity, raising the risk of arrhythmias.

In the past, uterine relaxation was obtained with potent volatile anesthetics that required general anesthesia, introducing the possibility of difficult airway, aspiration, and hypoxia. High concentrations of volatile anesthetics are not as easily titratable as nitroglycerin, which is also a potent uterine relaxant. Intravenous or sublingual nitroglycerin provides rapid onset of uterine relaxation and has a very short duration of action. If intravenous or sublingual nitroglycerin does not provide adequate relaxation, rapid induction of general anesthesia should occur, followed by administration of a high concentration of a volatile halogenated agent.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Nitroglycerin results in the release of nitric oxide, which mediates the relaxation of smooth muscle.

White blood cells will tend to release inflammatory mediators in storage, and their removal before storage results in a pRBC product that is much less likely to result in either a febrile non-hemolytic or allergic transfusion reaction. Leukoreduced pRBCs have a lower concentration of exogenous proteins that the patient's immune system can react with to cause an allergic reaction. Likewise, there is a very limited time for the white blood cells in the donor's whole blood to release the inflammatory mediators that cause a febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction following transfusion into the patient. Pre-storage leukoreduction of pRBCs can be augmented by washing the pRBCs of their supernatant prior to transfusing them into the patient, further minimizing the concentration of soluble inflammatory mediators or residual white blood cells that are transfused into the patient.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The practice of leukoreduction of pRBCs is largely universal throughout most of Europe and Canada, though&nbsp;universal leukoreduction is not yet standard practice in the United States.&nbsp;Leukoreduction refers to the use of filters to remove leukocytes from blood products. This practice is performed to decrease the risk of alloimmunization, febrile transfusion reactions, and transfusion-transmitted cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">HLA alloimmunization occurs when the patient is exposed to host antigens. By minimizing the cellular component of a transfusion that has not been specifically crossmatched to a patient's circulating antibodies, there is a decreased risk of both febrile transfusion reaction and the formation of new antibodies. The prevention of the formation of new autoantibodies is incredibly important in patients who are awaiting organ transplantation and the increased presence of autoantibodies increases the risk of transplant rejection. The reduction in the transmission of intracellular CMV which resides within leukocytes to an immunocompromised host is another benefit of leukoreduction. There are no major risks or downsides to leukoreduction outside of a modest cost for the physical filters, and thus many have argued for its universal use on all units of pRBC's given the theoretical benefits. While these theoretical benefits have not been definitively demonstrated in practice, most hospital systems even in the United States have adopted the practice of universal leukoreduction for their pRBC's.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Other blood products are not routinely leukoreduced because pRBC's have the highest concentration of cellular components of any of the other blood products. When whole blood is centrifuged initially to separate packed red blood cells from platelet-rich plasma, the vast majority of the leukocytes in the serum are centrifuged off of the plasma along with the erythrocytes. When platelets are centrifuged off of the platelet-rich plasma to form platelets and fresh frozen plasma, any remaining leukocytes are centrifuged off with the platelets, leaving the largely acellular plasma. Thus, because pRBCs have the highest concentration of leukocytes, they are the blood product that is most likely to benefit from leukoreduction.</span><br><br>OTHER REACTIONS:<br><u><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Acute hemolytic reactions</b></span></u><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;occur when ABO-incompatible blood is transfused into a patient and is not prevented by leukoreduction.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><u><b>Delayed hemolytic reactions</b></u>&nbsp;occur when ABO-compatible but otherwise uncrossmatched blood is transfused into a patient and is not prevented by leukoreduction.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><u><b>Septic reactions</b></u>:&nbsp;While the transmission of the intracellular pathogen cytomegalovirus (CMV) is all but eliminated through the use of leukoreduction, the major risk of CMV infection is in immunocompromised adults.

As extracellular potassium concentrations rise, electromechanical activity ceases, and the heart is arrested in diastole. Cooling the cardioplegia solution prior to administration allows the heart’s metabolic activity to be reduced by up to 97%, allowing up to 40 minutes of relatively protected perfusion-free time.&nbsp;After&nbsp;completion of the surgical procedure, the heart can be restarted via reperfusion with warmed, normokalemic blood.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Traditionally, cardioplegia solution was administered only via a small-bore catheter or needle in an&nbsp;</span><em>antegrade</em><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;fashion at the aortic root or directly into the coronary arteries. While this anatomically logical technique allows for effective circulation of cardioplegia solution to the myocardium in most patients, various limitations of this technique rapidly became apparent. Patients with distorted aortic valvular or coronary arterial anatomy, those with severe AI, and those with substantial CAD often developed inadequate cardioplegia for full myocardial protection. Aortic insufficiency poses a particularly strong contraindication to reliance on antegrade cardioplegia delivered to the aortic root because backflow of cardioplegia solution into the left ventricle through the incompetent valve may produce myocardial distention and, thus, increase metabolic demand. In these patient populations, an approach involving the infusion of potassium-enriched cardioplegia solution into the coronary sinus through a balloon-tipped catheter resulted in superior outcomes. This method of&nbsp;</span><em>retrograde</em><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;cardioplegia remains in widespread use today for patients with significant AI, those with CAD, and those undergoing complex procedures involving the proximal coronary arteries or aortic root.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Notable limitations of retrograde cardioplegia compared to an antegrade approach include relatively poor distribution of cardioplegia solution to the right coronary artery territory, particularly the anterior free wall, as well as relative capillary hypoperfusion. Patients must, therefore, be judiciously selected for this technique. In addition, it is now increasingly accepted that a combination of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia may allow for a superior degree of myocardial protection relative to either approach in isolation. Thus, the techniques are now frequently coupled during cardiac surgery with CPB.</span></left></td></tr><tr><td width="33.333333333333336%"><left><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">A thromboelastogram is performed on a 47-year-old male with end-stage liver disease awaiting liver transplantation.

The etiology of hyponatremia with this fluid management strategy is thought to be twofold.&nbsp; First, hypotonic fluids result in excess free water and should be replaced with isotonic fluids.

background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">When a physician anesthesiologist and a CRNA provide care for a patient, certain requirements must be met to provide proper payment.&nbsp; A physician is said to “medically direct” or “medically supervise” one or more CRNAs depending on these conditions.&nbsp; Under medical direction, CMS pays the physician and the CRNA each 50 percent of the total claim for each case.&nbsp; For example, if a physician covers two rooms each with a CRNA under medical direction, the physician is reimbursed 50 percent of each case’s claim, while each CRNA is reimbursed the remaining 50 percent of the respective case.&nbsp; Under medical supervision, CMS may only allow 3 base units per procedure, or in certain cases 1 additional if the physician documents presence at induction.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Given the potentially substantially lower payment under medical supervision, an anesthesiology department and clinical or staffing director must pay close attention to which requirements are met for direction or supervision.&nbsp; The first requirement is the concurrency number.&nbsp; A physician may medically direct no more than 4 rooms with CRNAs.&nbsp; Regardless of which conditions are met, if a physician is attempting to furnish services for 5 rooms concurrently, then the payment would automatically be at the lower “medically supervised” rate.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);

The same physician does not have to perform all of the requirements.&nbsp; For example, in a group practice, one physician may evaluate the patient preoperatively, another direct the CRNA during the case, and another attends to the patient post-operatively.&nbsp; The physician may decide which portions of the anesthetic plan are the most demanding.&nbsp; While the start and end of the case may meet this criterion, they may not always do so.&nbsp; For example, ending a mild sedation case may not be demanding whereas managing the hemodynamic changes after the release of an aortic cross-clamp may be.&nbsp; Leaving the immediate area of the operating suite and devoting extensive time to an emergency case such as providing real-time TEE guidance for difficult ECMO placement in the emergency department would not meet the requirements for payment at the medically directed rate.&nbsp; Another example would be going to the trauma intensive care unit to perform a thoracic epidural for rib fracture pain, which again&nbsp;would not meet the requirements for payment at the medically directed rate regarding payment of the cases in the operating room.<br><br>More important to understand is that CMS manual lists the requirements for certain types of payment, but it does not take the place of medical judgment.&nbsp; In certain cases, at certain times of the day, or in certain situations, the physician may have to leave the responsibilities associated with medical direction because another emergency is considered higher acuity.&nbsp; Doing so does not automatically cause the physician to be judged negligent, only the payment rate is changed.&nbsp; One example would be an obstetrical facility with an anesthesiologist and CRNA overnight.&nbsp; If a surgery is underway and being medical directed, then an emergency cesarean section is called, the best option would be for the physician to start the emergency procedure instead of waiting for their backup colleague to arrive from home.&nbsp; Per CMS rules, they would not be able to bill for medical direction of the first procedure that was already underway, though this would be the most appropriate clinical care for the patients involved.</div><div><br></div><div><div><strong>Bottom Line:&nbsp;</strong>To satisfy the requirements for medical direction, the physician must:<br></div><ul><li>perform a pre-anesthetic examination and evaluation;</li><li>prescribe the anesthetic plan;</li><li>personally participate in the most demanding procedures in the anesthesia plan, including, if applicable, induction and emergence;</li><li>ensure that any procedures in the anesthesia plan that he or she does not perform are performed by a qualified individual;</li><li>monitor the course of anesthesia administration at frequent intervals;</li><li>remain physically present and available for immediate diagnosis and treatment of emergencies;&nbsp;and</li><li>provide indicated post-anesthesia care.</li></ul></div></left></td></tr><tr><td width="33.333333333333336%"><left><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);

Positive (increased) lusitropy may be represented by a downward and rightward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR) curve of a pressure-volume loop, which is best illustrated by the curve corresponding to point A. In this state, increased myocardial compliance is demonstrated by an increased left ventricular end-diastolic blood volume for a given end-diastolic pressure.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Pressure-volume (PV) loops may be used to illustrate the operating conditions of the heart by plotting the pressures within a ventricular chamber as a function of the volume within the ventricle throughout the cardiac cycle.

This relationship is illustrated on the PV loop via a downward and rightward shift of the slope at the end of diastole (end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship or EDPVR). By contrast, an increase in preload would be indicated by rightward movement of the PV loop along the same EDPVR slope, as greater blood volume is subject to slightly higher pressures given the same degree of lusitropy.

The slope of the ESPVR serves as an index of myocardial contractility (inotropy). Accordingly, a decrease in inotropy would be represented as a downward and rightward shift of the ESPVR.&nbsp; This is not to be confused with an increase in afterload, which would be associated with greater end-systolic pressures and a higher end-systolic volume, causing the PV loop to translate upward and to the right along the same ESPVR curve.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">As an example, congestive heart failure with pure left ventricular systolic dysfunction would be seen as a downward shift in the ESPVR, signifying decreased contractility or negative inotropy. To maintain stroke volume, sympathetic activation and fluid retention would cause an increase in left ventricular volume, and end-diastolic pressures might increase as a result (producing a rightward translation of the PV loop along EDPVR slope). An individual can also exhibit decreased left ventricular contractility and decreased compliance&nbsp;simultaneously, which would substantially reduce stroke volume. For instance, such conditions may arise in the event of an acute myocardial infarction involving a large portion of the left ventricular wall, which would place the patient at risk of cardiogenic shock.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span><br><strong>Bottom Line:&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Pressure-volume loops can be used to illustrate changes in cardiac work due to changes in ventricular pressure as a function of ventricular volume. &nbsp;Positive lusitropy is depicted by a rightward and downward shift of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship curve, which illustrates a more compliant ventricle that can accommodate larger volumes at decreased pressures.</span></left></td></tr><tr><td width="33.333333333333336%"><left><div>Compared with adult patients who fast from clear liquids for &gt; 4 hours, those who fast between 2-4 hours have:</div>

A visual or tactile train-of-four (TOF) pattern is most often used, in which four fixed, high-amplitude stimuli are delivered at 0.5-second intervals along the course of a peripheral nerve (such as the ulnar or facial nerve) to elicit muscle contractions (twitches).&nbsp; However, sustained (tetanic) and double-burst stimulation patterns are also employed.&nbsp; When nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents are used to achieve muscle relaxation, the percentage of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction that are competitively occupied by the drug can be approximated via the degree of “fade” and the number of detectable twitches. Unfortunately, while these qualitative metrics are useful in detecting early recovery from deep levels of neuromuscular blockade, they remain insensitive for small but significant degrees of residual paralysis.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Quantitative peripheral nerve stimulation</strong>&nbsp;techniques require more sophisticated equipment but provide objective and thus more sensitive metrics of residual blockade. &nbsp;Mechanomyography (MMG) is a form of quantitative neuromuscular monitoring that is acknowledged as the gold standard for the measurement of blockade, though it is reserved primarily for research settings. &nbsp;Acceleromyography (AMG), by contrast, is more widely available and remains the most common quantitative technique used clinically.&nbsp; By applying an accelerometer to a point that will move with nerve stimulation—such as the pad of the thumb, which will twitch when the ulnar nerve is triggered—the acceleration at that site will correlate with the force of muscle contraction.&nbsp; When AMG is used, the magnitude of the acceleration is measured with each stimulus to yield a numerical TOF ratio from 0-1, with values approaching 1 indicating full neuromuscular recovery.&nbsp; Most sources now recommend that a TOF ratio &gt; 0.90 to 0.95 be used as a marker of adequate reversal.&nbsp; Though subject to its own limitations, AMG is the most sensitive technique for the assessment of residual blockade when compared to qualitative assessments or clinical maneuvers.&nbsp;</li></ul><img alt="" src ="Images/43a962bf-29db-48a8-a6b5-183a37fa3d92.png"><br></left></td></tr><tr><td width="33.333333333333336%"><left><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends what regarding uterotonic therapy?</span>

All the other answers decrease the risk of post dural puncture headache.&nbsp; The size of needles increases as the gauge decrease.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Postpartum headache can be categorized into primary, secondary, and post-procedural causes.&nbsp; Primary is a recurrence of a disorder for which the patient already suffered prior to delivery: migraine, tension-type, cluster, and ‘other’ causes.&nbsp; Secondary headaches occur due to another medical condition and are attributed to head and/or neck trauma, cranial or cervical vascular disorders, nonvascular intracranial disorder, substance abuse or withdrawal, infection, and psychiatric.&nbsp; Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) occurs after intentional puncture of the dura with a spinal needle or accidental puncture with an epidural needle.&nbsp; The rate of PDPH occurring after spinal needle puncture is between 1%-11%.&nbsp; The incidence of accidental puncture with an epidural needle is around 1.5%, with a 52% chance of developing PDPH.&nbsp; The pain is typically described as fronto-occipital with radiation to the neck and there may be associated cranial nerve deficits.&nbsp; The pain may be mild or totally debilitating.&nbsp; The key to diagnosis is a headache that changes with position; getting worse with upright positioning and being relieved when the patient lays flat.&nbsp; PDPH typically occurs within the first 24-48 hours following the dural puncture.&nbsp; The headache can last up to a week although symptoms may persist for months or even years.&nbsp; The precise cause of PDPH is still debated; leakage of CSF initiates the syndrome.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); text-decoration-line: underline;"><br>The incidence of PDPH is influenced by several patient factors</span><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">:</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Age: most common in patients less than 40 years old and uncommon in those older than 60 years.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Gender: women are two times more likely to get a PDPH when compared with men.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Weight: morbidly obese patients are less likely to suffer from PDPH.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Pregnancy: pregnant patients are more likely to suffer from PDPH.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Previous History: a history of PDPH with previous spinal anesthesia is associated with the development of PDPH with subsequent spinal anesthetics.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);

Pencil point needles are less likely to cause PDPH when compared with beveled needles.&nbsp; The pencil point needle most commonly used in practice today is the Whitacre needle although the Sprotte is also used.&nbsp; Beveled needles that are available include the Quincke and Atrauman needles.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Provider Experience: when a more experienced provider is performing the procedure the risk of PDPH is less compared to providers who have less experience.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Loss of Resistance Technique: using air for loss of resistance technique may result in pneumocephalus with accidental dural puncture thus may increase the risk of PDPH when compared with saline.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Treatment for PDPH has several components.&nbsp; It should start with psychological support since the patient may be angry and upset about this iatrogenic problem.&nbsp; Many advocate giving an intravenous fluid bolus or increasing the patient's oral intake, however, this has never been proven beneficial; it certainly can help to ensure the patient is not dehydrated.&nbsp; Caffeine has been used for many years despite a lack of clear evidence of efficacy.&nbsp; Other therapies not widely used but that have been studied include&nbsp;serotonin receptor agonists (like sumatriptan), adrenocorticotrophic hormone, pregabalin, hydrocortisone, and methylergonovine.&nbsp; Epidural blood patch is the gold standard of therapy and should be offered to patients who suffer from PDPH.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); text-decoration-line: underline;"><br>Techniques to minimize the incidence of unintentional dural puncture include</span><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">:</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Identification of the ligamentum flavum during epidural placement.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Understanding the likely depth of the epidural space in different patient populations/sizes.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Advancement of the needle between contractions in a parturient since pain may elicit movement in the patient.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">- Clearing the needle of clotted blood or bone plugs as this may impede the&nbsp;ability to detect loss of resistance.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Management of unintentional dural puncture depends on the clinical setting and the provider/facility comfort.&nbsp; If it occurs during epidural placement, the provider should halt movement of the needle and either remove it or place the stylet back into the needle to prevent further CSF leakage.&nbsp; At this point, the provider may place the epidural catheter into the subarachnoid space and use this for pain management or resite the epidural at a different interspace.&nbsp; If the catheter is threaded, it is incredibly important that the catheter is labeled appropriately and only experienced providers are giving medication through it as there is a chance it could be misinterpreted as an epidural catheter and too much medication given resulting in a high spinal.<br></span><br><strong>Bottom Line:&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">Unintentional dural puncture during epidural placement is a risk that occurs even with the most vigilant and experienced providers.&nbsp;

Caudal anesthesia can reduce the volatile anesthetic required and provide analgesia for six to eight hours as a single injection. Commonly used anesthetics are 0.125% bupivacaine, 0.25% bupivacaine, and 0.2% ropivacaine. Opioids can also be given through infusions, but caution must be used because neonates and infants are sensitive to opioids and can develop apnea with moderate doses.&nbsp;Epinephrine is often added to the local injections to test for intravascular injection of the anesthetics. If the needle is inserted intravascularly and epinephrine is injected, peaked T waves and elevated heart rate and blood pressure should be noted. One technique to avoid large intravascular injections is to divide the injections into three aliquots and wait for 20 to 30 seconds after each injection to ensure that no previously discussed symptoms occur before proceeding to the next injection. If the injection is intravascular, the needle can be repositioned. Total spinal blockade can also occur because the dural sac in infants is located at S3, just a short distance away from the puncture site. Other complications include urinary retention, hypotension, seizures, and local anesthetic cardiac arrest.</span><br><br><img alt="" src ="Images/7e1d6d0e-e1e9-445f-a186-afd4f7952815.png"></left></td></tr><tr><td width="33.333333333333336%"><left>What are comparisons and differences between myasthenia gravis and Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome?

<u><b>Shift to point A</b></u>&nbsp;<br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Shift to A indicates an increase in preload and stroke volume.

The increased blood pressure is due to increased venous return and increased systemic vascular resistance. The alpha-1 receptors cause both arterial and venous constriction, resulting in increased afterload and preload, respectively. It is believed that venoconstriction diverts blood from the splanchnic circulation to the heart. This increased venous return to the left heart increases the end-diastolic volume or preload.&nbsp; The venoconstriction is thought to be the predominant factor affecting blood pressure.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The exact impact of phenylephrine on stroke volume is largely unknown. But studies have suggested that the effects on stroke volume depend on the patient's volume status. On the Frank-Starling curve, patients who are on the steep portion of the curve (volume dependent) will have an increase in stroke volume due to the increased preload. However, those who are on the flat portion of the curve (volume independent) will not have any increased stroke volume from the increased preload.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Phenylephrine can reduce cardiac output due to reduced heart rate and increased afterload, and this is mainly seen when stroke volume does not increase, as is the case in volume-independent patients.

The toxicity due to fluoride is related to the duration of high levels of fluoride and peak concentrations.

The Bohr effect occurs as a result of the uptake of carbon dioxide from the fetal to the maternal hemoglobin. The maternal circulation at the materno-fetal interface becomes acidotic due to this increased carbon dioxide uptake. This causes a right shift of the&nbsp;oxyhemoglobin dissociation&nbsp;curve promoting maternal hemoglobin oxygen release. The double Bohr effect is a result of fetal hemoglobin releasing carbon dioxide into the maternal circulation. The fetal blood becomes alkalotic causing a left shift of the fetal hemoglobin curve resulting in an increased affinity for oxygen. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen further shifting the curve to the left. Overall, the Bohr and double Bohr effect result in the transfer of oxygen from the mother to the fetus.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The Haldane effect and double Haldane effect work to enhance the transfer of carbon dioxide from the fetal to the maternal circulation. The Haldane effect explains the property of deoxygenated hemoglobin's ability to carry more carbon dioxide than oxygenated blood. So as the maternal hemoglobin unloads oxygen at the interface, its ability to carry carbon dioxide is increased carrying it in the form of bicarbonate and carboxyhemoglobin. In the fetal circulation, as fetal hemoglobin picks up oxygen its ability to carry carbon dioxide is decreased and it releases more carbon dioxide into the maternal circulation. The Haldane effect occurring in both the maternal and fetal circulations is termed the double Haldane effect.</span><br><br><img alt="" src ="Images/8ee54b4c-503b-4159-9b44-684bd4a898bc.png"></left></td></tr><tr><td width="33.333333333333336%"><left><div>What is most&nbsp;<strong>TRUE&nbsp;</strong>when fentanyl and morphine are used in the epidural catheter?</div>

This leads to hyperpolarization, desensitization, and flaccid paralysis after the initial depolarization as can be seen by the muscular fasciculations.

First synthesized in the 19th century, phosgene has been in industrial use for more than a century but achieved notoriety during World War I, when it was used extensively by both sides after 1915. It has caused greater than 85% of all deaths from chemical warfare agents (as of 2017).</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Damage caused by phosgene results from the presence of a highly reactive carbonyl group attached to 2 chlorine atoms. Phosgene initially targets type I and II pneumocytes, which can lead to free radical release. This is followed by a secondary attack involving release of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins (causing vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and platelet disaggregation), bradykinin (causing increased capillary permeability), 5-hydroxytryptamine (causing constriction of postcapillary vessels), thromboxane A2 (causing vasoconstriction), and the release of complement activating enzymes (leading to attraction of leukocytes and leukotriene release).</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Phosgene itself is a colorless gas that dissolves slowly in water, undergoing hydrolysis to form carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid. When liquid phosgene is released, it quickly turns into a gas that stays close to the ground and spreads rapidly. Slow dissolution allows phosgene to enter respiratory tissue without significant upper airway damage. Necrosis follows inflammation of delicate terminal airways and alveoli. Alveolar capillaries leak large volumes of serum into the alveolar septa, producing pulmonary edema. In some cases, death has followed exposure to high concentrations of phosgene without the development of toxic pulmonary edema. The reason for this is obscure, but may be related to hypoxia as a result of intense laryngeal or bronchospasm.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The management of phosgene toxicity is supportive.

Most common indications include trauma with active hemorrhage, cranial aneurysm repair, total hip arthroplasty, hepatic resections, and maxillofacial or sinus surgery. There are numerous terms for this desired hypotension; controlled hypotension, deliberate hypotension, and induced hypotension are most commonly used. It is defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50 mm Hg to 65 mm Hg or 20-30% below baseline. Most often it is requested to obtain a "bloodless" surgical field or to decrease the total bleeding and hence blood transfusion requirement. The most commonly used pharmacologic agents used to produce hypotension are beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and direct-acting vasodilators. The ideal agents have the following characteristics: short onset, easily reversible, effortlessly titratable, safe with minimal toxic metabolites, and a predictable dose-dependent effect.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The principle behind controlled hypotension is a natural survival mechanism. When profuse bleeding occurs, the blood pressure drops. This decreases the amount of further bleeding until surgery completion and recovery. This is why recommendations for active hemorrhage in trauma scenarios now recommend allowing blood pressure to be on the lower range of normal.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">For spine surgery, the main goal of lowering blood pressure is to decrease the amount of bleeding and hence the blood transfusion requirement. It was postulated that&nbsp;lowering arterial blood pressure in the spine would decrease blood loss, however, epidural venous plexus pressure and intraosseous pressure are the two determinants of blood loss when bone decortication is involved. Both of these considerations are independent of arterial blood pressure. Lowering the blood pressure in spine surgery can cause problems with other organ systems including decreased spinal cord perfusion and the potential risk of postoperative visual loss.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Controlled hypotension may also be requested for intracranial aneurysm repair. Blood pressure may need to be lowered during microscopic dissection, particularly to decrease the risk of rupture. If bleeding occurs, lowering the blood pressure will reduce bleeding from the aneurysm, allowing better visualization of the anatomy and all associated vessels. Some surgeons will ask for adenosine to be administered in a rupture situation to temporarily cease all blood flow. Ample consideration for the physiology of intracranial perfusion must first occur before inducing blood pressure changes since autoregulation may be abnormal in certain states. Chronic hypertension with a rightward shift of the autoregulatory curve and vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage are two examples. For this reason, a more common practice is temporary occlusion of the major feeding artery by the surgeon (termed temporary clip). This causes a temporary cessation of flow to that surgical field; blood flow to the area distal to the clip is via collateral vessels. There is a possible risk of vessel damage and regional ischemia with this practice compared to controlled hypotension. However, on the other hand, controlled hypotension may cause global ischemia.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Functional endoscopic sinus surgery is a minimally invasive approach to sinus pathology. Bleeding is one of the major complications, and when it occurs it significantly reduces the ability of the surgeon to operate. This can prolong surgical time, increase the risk of orbital cellulitis, and increase the risk of optic nerve injuries. Thus, controlled hypotension may be requested to decrease this bleeding.</span></left></td></tr><tr><td width="33.333333333333336%"><left><div>What is true regarding lithium use?</div>

Compliance describes how easily a change in pressure changes the volume of a system.&nbsp;If the natural frequency is too low, the system will resonate beyond the arterial pressure wave, and the displayed pressure wave will be an amplified version of the true intra-arterial pressure. In this underdamped system, the resonance of the measurement system will be incorporated into the measurement of the intra-arterial blood pressure, resulting in the systolic blood pressure appearing higher than it actually is. In contrast, when the system is overdamped, the blood pressure waveform is not transmitted accurately to the transducer, and details such as the peak systolic pressure appear lower than what is true within the artery.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">When excessive damping is present (overdamping), which occurs due to factors that increase the compliance of or resistance within the circuit—such as the addition of stopcocks, air bubbles, or distensible tubing—the amplitude and resolution of the waveform will be artificially reduced. This produces a slurring and flattening of the waveform that results in a factitiously reduced pulse pressure and loss of the dicrotic notch, although the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is generally preserved. Meanwhile, inadequate damping (underdamping) may cause movement of the measurement system itself (eg, "whip," or reverberations from intra-arterial oscillation of the catheter) to appear in the arterial tracing, producing distortion of the true waveform with superimposed smaller waves and overshoot of the measured systolic blood pressure.</span></left></td></tr><tr><td width="33.333333333333336%"><left><div>You are performing a bedside percutaneous tracheostomy in the Intensive Care Unit for a patient requiring long-term positive pressure ventilation.

<u><b>Cuffed low pressure tracheostomy tube<br></b></u><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Cuffed tracheostomy tubes are necessary when positive pressure ventilation is required, or in situations where airway protection is essential to minimize aspiration of oral or gastric secretions (although all cuffs are not an absolute barrier to secretions).</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Cuffed tubes have a soft balloon around the distal end of the tube which inflates to seal the airway.&nbsp; Most temporary tracheostomies inserted to assist with ventilation will be inserted whilst a patient is in an intensive care unit and still requiring some degree of positive pressure ventilation.&nbsp; This will require the use of a cuffed tracheostomy tube, although it is recognized that long term mechanical ventilation can be delivered through an uncuffed tube in certain circumstances.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Obstruction of a cuffed tracheostomy tube is a potentially life-threatening emergency.&nbsp; If the tracheostomy tube lumen is occluded when the cuff is inflated, the patient will not be able to breathe around the tube, assuming the cuff is correctly positioned and inflated within the trachea.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever possible, a dual cannula tube (i.e. a tube with an inner cannula) should be used, particularly for patients cared for outside of a specialist environment who may not have immediate access to clinicians with emergency airway skills.&nbsp; Double cannula tubes have an outer cannula to keep the airway open and an inner cannula which acts as a removable liner to facilitate cleaning of impacted secretions.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Occlusion&nbsp;at the tracheostomy tube opening can occur when the cuff is inflated and a Passy-Muir speaking valve is placed.&nbsp; The Passy-Muir valve allows for air to be pulled in through the tracheostomy tube, but not exhaled.&nbsp; With the tracheostomy tube cuff deflated, the patient is able to exhale around the tracheostomy tube and through their vocal cords, allowing for speech.&nbsp; If the cuff is inflated, the patient is able to inhale but unable to exhale against the one-way valve.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Laryngectomy patients have their entire larynx removed, with a stoma connection of their trachea to the anterior neck.&nbsp; There is no connection between the lungs/trachea and the mouth or nose.&nbsp; Thus, there is no way to intubate these patients via the oral or nasal route.&nbsp; In tracheostomy patients, it is possible to intubate through the mouth or nose and bypass the tracheostomy opening.&nbsp; Because these two situations are so different, and confusion could lead to catastrophe, the United Kingdom created the Tracheostomy Safety Project (http://www.tracheostomy.org.uk/).&nbsp; This website has algorithms for the management of tracheostomy patients as well as laryngectomy patients.&nbsp; Further, it has "Bedhead Templates" that can be placed at the patient's bedside to remind staff about the particular airway in the event of an emergency.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Lastly, some patients with un-reconstructable tracheas will present with a tracheal T-tube.&nbsp; This is a soft, cuffless device shaped like the letter T.&nbsp; It providers support above and below the tracheostomy site, with an end coming out of the tracheostomy stoma (like the letter T).&nbsp; In an emergency, this device can be forcibly removed by grasping the protruding end at the stoma and pulling, as the device is soft.&nbsp; Under normal circumstances, the device partially occludes the stoma as well as the proximal/distal trachea, thus intubation from above will encounter resistance if the T-tube is not removed.&nbsp; A supraglottic airway could potentially be used, as air can travel around the T-tube; however, the stoma end of the T-tube would need to be occluded.</span></left></td></tr><tr><td width="33.333333333333336%"><left>You wish to study the presence or absence of hyperlipidemia in women over the age of 65 versus in men over the age of 65.
